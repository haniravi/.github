# GitHub Guildelines ![Under Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/under-development-orange.svg)

Dedicated repository for GitHub organization guidelines and related content.


### Getting Started

[Community health files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization) in `.github/` directory customize repository templates for issues, pull requests and contributions. GitHub will use and display this files for any public repository in the organization that does not have its own file of that type.

Additional GitHub-related data (e.g. cheat-sheets, bookmarks) _may_ be found on Wiki.
